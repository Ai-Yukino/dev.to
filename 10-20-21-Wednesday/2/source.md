## Set up React + Vite project

Run

```
npm init vite@latest pedro-hooks -- --template react
```

to get almost all the React boilerplate. Next, run

```
cd pedro-hooks
npm i
vite
```

to install the package dependencies and start the dev server.

## 📑 Other notes

### ❓ Why are hooks hard to learn?

It's probably becasue they need to be understood in the context of a concrete React application, i.e. their purpose is to literally "hook" together rendered components by sharing logic which handles state changes and rendering.

To really appreciate hooks, you probably also need to have struggled with creating react applications using the traditional class components syntax.
